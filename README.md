# **Surchat** - *Interactive Survey Application*
### The quality of data emerging from online surveys is low compared to other data types. Studies have determined that one of the reasons for this is that users are bored while answering the survey.
### In our application, we have added a **chat room** on the survey answering screen so that users do not get bored while answering the survey.
